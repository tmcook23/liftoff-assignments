### Overview
My project will serve as a digital library for teachers to manage their classroom's books. It will include a database of that teacher's personal collection of books within their own classroom. Those books will be classified by title, author, genre, description, reading level, and the name of the student (if applicable) who has checked out the book. The application will allow teachers to track their inventory, including which books are checked out to which students.

This will be useful for tracking inventory, and making sure students are accountable for any books they "check out" from the teacher's collection.

### Features
- User login: Users (teachers) will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a library page, detailing the contents of that user's classroom library.
- Add book: User will be able to add an entry, which may include: title, author, genre, description, and reading level, and student name.
- Edit book: User will be able to edit details.
- Remove book: User will be able to remove a book when logged in. This will be useful in case a book gets lost/damaged/is otherwise removed from classroom circulation.
- "Checked-out books" page: User wil be able to see a list of books currently checked out from the collection.
